## Project Description:
Drawing inspiration from the thought-provoking themes of "freedom" and "peace" explored in the popular anime series "Attack on Titan," I embarked on a creative journey during a hackathon to develop a decentralized forum akin to Reddit. This unique platform distinguishes itself by curating a collection of articles that revolve exclusively around the concepts of "freedom" and "peace." To ensure the utmost relevance, each article undergoes meticulous AI moderation, guaranteeing alignment with these overarching themes.

In an effort to foster engagement and recognize exceptional contributions, we hold a periodic selection process where the top three articles, as determined by the number of likes, are chosen. As a token of appreciation, the authors of these distinguished pieces are rewarded with a random allocation of USDC (a stablecoin) and an exclusive Admin NFT (Non-Fungible Token). With the possession of an Admin NFT, users are bestowed with the authority to remove posts that have eluded the AI's moderation process. Should a deletion request be submitted by a majority of Admin NFT holders, the post in question will be promptly removed, maintaining the forum's commitment to quality content.

Through this innovative platform, I aim to create a space where individuals can explore, discuss, and promote the fundamental principles of "freedom" and "peace" in a dynamic and engaging manner.

## How it's Made:
1. The core contract of the project is implemented in Solidity, using Foundry as the development framework. Foundry provides tools for contract compilation, deployment, and unit testing.

2. Leverage OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo for efficient article review and moderation.

3. Develop the frontend using Next.js.

4. Utilize Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling and layout design.

5. Deploy the website using Fleek as the deployment tool for seamless hosting and maintenance.

6. Deploy the contract on Optimism、Linea、Scroll、ThunderCore、Zircuit

## Potential Future Enhancements:
1. Enhance the security of the smart contract by adding comprehensive unit tests.

2. Improve the AI's ability to review and moderate posts effectively.

3. Enhance the UI/UX to provide a better user experience.

## Different Parts:
1. Deploying smart contracts on different chains to provide users with more choices.

2. Changing the distribution of rewards from automatic to manual.
